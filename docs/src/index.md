# SolarFunctions.jl

*Julia functions for computing Sun-related quantites.*

`SolarFunctions.jl` is a collection of pure functions which compute useful quantites for Sun-related calculations, such as [irradiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance) and [solar position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_of_the_Sun). It is the fundamental package of [`Solaria.jl`](https://github.com/nicomignoni/Solaria.jl), which is inspired by [`pvlib`](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). A detailed list of the implemented function is provided in the [API docs](api.md).   

Install `SolarFunctions.jl` from the Julia REPL
